Enlightenment DR17 is the next generation of UNIX graphical
environments.  It is not just a window manager, but it is also a
desktop shell.  A desktop shell means a window manager plus a file
manager plus configuration utilities all in one.

Requires: lua, and then eina, eet, evas, ecore, embryo, edje, e_dbus
and efreet, all available at SlackBuilds.org (build requirements
exactly in the order given).
