Eeze is part of Enlightenment DR17 foundation libraries.

Eeze is a library for manipulating devices through udev with a simple and fast api. It interfaces directly with libudev, avoiding such middleman daemons as udisks/upower or hal, to immediately gather device information the instant it becomes known to the system.
