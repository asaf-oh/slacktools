Eet is part of Enlightenment DR17 foundation libraries.

Eet is a tiny library designed to write an arbitrary set of chunks of
data to a file and optionally compress each chunk (very much like a
zip file) and allow fast random-access reading of the file later on.

Requires: eina, available at SlackBuilds.org.
