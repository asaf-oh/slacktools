currently contains the 'autoslack.sh' script that uses m4 template (generic.SlackBuild.as) and
a config file (sample: cfg.d/wine.conf) to generate wine.SlackBuild (for example).

all the m4 macros are in autoslack.m4

future versions will also
* generate wine.info and maybe more.
* attempt to auto-upgrade by bumping versions.
* enable to change configuration options and the like.
